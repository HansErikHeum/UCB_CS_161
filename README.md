# UCB_CS_161

Different projects Mikal Viga and me did in the course **CS 161 - Computer Security**.
Feel free to use everything as you like.

Disclaimer:
The Safe File Sharing System, which is one of the projects, did very good on the hidden tests. However it is not completely safe, use at own risk :)
